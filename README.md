## :dart: Introduction

Hey there! I am Leandro Nunes, a proud Brazilian with 3 years of success stories as a technology professional. My
graduation in Public Relations and Business Management was taken at [UFPR](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidade_Federal_do_Paran%C3%A1) and
I have courses and boot camps related to Frontend, React, Tests
and English. This knowledge allowed me to build my career acting as a Frontend Developer
within Brazilian and international projects.

But what I like most as a professional is coding in JavaScript (React) and seeing the results of my work supporting the business's growth.

I am from [Curitiba](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curitiba), PR, Brazil. <br>
